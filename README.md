# tagcyclr

i'm trying to remove as much resistance as possible from me sharing my art. i've been making art for decades, in many different fields and so hashtags i use are super varried since i take photos, make music, make 2D and 3D art, etc. when it comes to sharing with the world and figuring out hashtags, etc, my brain just gets fried, i just wanna keep creating. so i decided to make a little assistant tool for me to remove that resistance and just quickly create hashtag blocks from tags i've saved. so far i've been sharing daily.
